I recently graduated from **Springboard** and already started working on my first customer projects as a **freelance Web Developer**.

Having worked as a Musician for the last 8 years, I discovered my love for coding while doing an computer science entry test at a local university just out of curiousity. Though passing the test, I decided to go the Bootcamp route at Springboard and 12 months later I am using my React, Javascript and Python based techstack to work on my first commercial projects as a freelancer.

Skills: Skills: REACT / JAVASCRIPT / NODE / EXPRESS / PYTHON / FLASK / POSTGRESQL
