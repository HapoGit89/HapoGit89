## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

my Name is Hannes, I'm a Web Developer recently graduated from Springboard and already working on my first customer projects as a freelance Web Developer.

After having worked as a Musician for the last 8 years, I discovered my love for coding while doing an computer science entry test at a local university just out of curiousity.
Though passing the test, I decided to go the Bootcamp route at [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/courses/software-engineering-career-track/) and 12 months later I am using my React, Javascript and Python based techstack to work on my first commercial projects as a freelancer.

The first commercial projects will appear here soon, meanwhile here are the repos for two milestone projects I did during the bootcamp:


I'm always looking for new learning opportunities be it new freelance projects or work for companies.
